-- SOLAR-378: missed minutes are refilled soon after readings come back, not at the
-- next 6-hourly sunsynk-recover run.
--
-- A dead login, a SunSynk outage or a quiet logger all leave the same hole in
-- agg_minute. poll_commit already logs it in private.gaps when the first reading
-- after it lands. Now a hole longer than 10 minutes also puts the plant on
-- private.refill_queue. first_load_continue (every 2 minutes) takes up to 50
-- plants off the queue per run and starts recover for each, so one reconnect
-- fills within 2 minutes and a SunSynk-wide outage never starts every plant's
-- fill in the same minute. Holes of 10 minutes or less wait for the 6-hourly run.
-- A plant is queued once per hole (primary key) and leaves the queue when its
-- recover run is started; a failed run is caught by the 6-hourly schedule.
--
-- poll_commit is the 0137 body with only the marked lines added.
-- first_load_continue is the 0093 body plus the queue.
